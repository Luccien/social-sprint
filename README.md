# social-sprint
Volunteer-driven digital tools for youth clubs, schools, and students.
Many youth clubs and schools lack access to modern, engaging digital tools. Students often face outdated or inaccessible resources that don’t encourage creativity or collaboration.

Social Sprint is a community project that develops free online platforms and interactive websites tailored for young people. Our mission is to make technology accessible, fun, and educational, helping youth explore creativity, digital literacy, and teamwork.

🌍 Tools we are building

DemoForm – Fast, digital parental permission for demonstrations

QuickPermit – Instant parental slips for youth club events

Club Event Manager – Information hub for youth clubs (demo of QuickPermit + onboarding support)

Currently available in German, with English and multilingual support coming soon.

📊 Roadmap 2025

Reach 50 youth clubs in the next 3 months

Improve design & multilingual support

Build a core volunteer team (design, marketing, tech, organization)

Host showcase events with Berlin youth clubs

Grow towards 1,800+ clubs in Europe & North America (long-term vision)
